        "description": "I am a software developer with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and education. I began my journey in software development in 2023 and graduated from UTN – FRT in 2025. I have professional experience working at SAS, collaborating with clients, small business owners, and multidisciplinary teams to design efficient and practical solutions. I value teamwork, clear communication, and adaptability when facing new challenges. I also have experience teaching programming to adult students (18+), including working with individuals on the autism spectrum. This background has strengthened my ability to explain complex concepts clearly, apply inclusive learning strategies, and approach each project with empathy, patience, and attention to individual needs. I am passionate about building functional, meaningful digital products and continuously improving both my technical and interpersonal skills.",
